We have designed and created a website for a restaurant.
The home page has a navigation bar containing links to Menu, Gallery and About Page. It also has a Make reservation button. 
Make reservation button uses Modal element to display a pop-up.
The Home Page also contains links to order online and view restaurant location.
On scrolling down user finds a menu created using carousel which displays dishes, it also has hover effect.
On scrolling further there is a picture gallery. On clicking any picture, the picture opens in a gallery view. We used fancy-box element for this.
After this there is an information section which contains the restaurant location, operating hours, and contact information for the restaurant.
We added a make reservation button here as well. It uses Modal to display pop-up.
We added a form element with proper validations and a submit button.
We added a reviews section which contains progress bars.
In the footer we added icons to our social media handles and online order button.
