## Website description
### Home

This page of my webiste is the homepage. I have added a short description of myself and my aspirations. I have added navbar where we can see all the items like Home,about,portfolio and contact. Some tags which can be highlighted are:

<fontawesome> -  For my ease I have used Font Awesome which is the Internet's icon library and toolkit, used by millions of designers, developers, and content creators. I have used different icons for my navigation bar.
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links where we can navigate to different section of the webiste like about, portfolio etc.
<section> - I have used section tag to create different sections for my image and also the content.
<aboutme> - About me btn redirects me to about me page which I have explained below.
