# Assignment 1
======================

The project is for the first assignment of the web design course and demonstrates HTML and CSS. Following are tags I've used while creating the website.

This website helps finding fun places around Boston!
 
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page. I have added different images to make the UI more attractive.
 
A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab. I have added favicon for wander website which is a travel icon.
  
Document titles are defined by the 'title' element.
 
The visible part of the HTML document is between the 'body' and the '/body' tags.

For part B, I have used HTML 5 tags mentioned below:

<header> -	Represents the header of a document or a section. header here is 'ROUTE TO WANDER'
<audio> - Embeds a sound, or an audio stream in an HTML document. I ahve also added audio below the form using <audio> tag.
<footer> -	Represents the footer of a document or a section. In this case footer is 'COPYRIGHT 2022'
<main> -	Represents the main or dominant content of the document. In this website main area is the middle part of the webite where forms and audio are residing.
<article> -	Defines an article. I have defined the header part as an article in this case.
